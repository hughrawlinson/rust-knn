# K Nearest Neighbors in Rust

I needed to implement kNN in Rust because I was trying to remember a problem I
had once in implementing kNN using MongoDB's aggregation framework. I'm fairly
certain I was just failing to do understand the algorithm at the time. But now
I have this lil kNN toy in Rust for myself. Huzzah.
